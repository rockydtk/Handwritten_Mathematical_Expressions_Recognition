## INTRODUCTION
### 1. Handwritten Mathematical Expressions Recognition
If you've ever had to typeset mathematical expressions, you might have thought: wouldn’t it be great if I could just take a picture of a handwritten expression and have it be recognized automatically? Can you use computer vision to recognize handwritten mathematical expressions? In this project, we will prove that we can!

### 2. Project goals
- Building model to classify **Handwritten Mathematical Expressions** (Numbers and Operators) images.

- Making a **Web Flask application** so user can upload the images and perform calculation.

### 3. Project plan
Main steps:
1. Build Handwritten Equation Solver locally on OpenCV
2. Make Handwritten Equation Solver Flask App

## COLLECTING DATA
### 1. The Handwritten math symbols dataset
[The Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols) consists of `jpg` files (45x45). It includes:
- Basic Greek alphabet symbols like: `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`, `mu`, `sigma`, `phi` and `theta`
- English alphanumeric symbols
- All math operators and set operators
- Basic pre-defined math functions like: `log`, `lim`, `cos`, `sin`, `tan`
- Math symbols like: `\int`, `\sum`, `\sqrt`, `\delta` and more.

For simplicity, in this project, we only take into account 4 math operators: `plus`,`minus`,`addition`, and `division`.

### 2. Data Collection process 
During the data cleanning process, some inappropriate images were removed from the dataset
